1) refactor notebook with respect to package
   a) Rework preprocess function and maybe preprocessing module. In order to 
      CV we have to do time series splits as opposed to regular k-folds.
      The preprocess function doesn't work when we have split the data df into
      two data sets, because it does all the text preprocessing and encoding 
      seperately. So the training set, and testing set will be encoded
      according to different vocabularies which is a problem. The encoding 
      scheme is time independent because ideally it would be the entire
      dictionary. Need to be able to split up the preprocessing from the 
      data windowing, filtering, etc.
2) fix gpu + rerun analysis
3) write README.md
