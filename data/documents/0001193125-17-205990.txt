claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as
the net proceeds from the offering of such Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters bear to the aggregate offering price of the Securities. The relative fault

such Indemnified Person in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section&nbsp;8, in no event shall the Underwriters be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by
which the total price at which the Securities purchased by it were offered exceeds the amount of any damages that the Underwriters have otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged
