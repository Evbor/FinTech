                      PRESS RELEASE ISSUED ON MARCH 4, 1999

INTEL TO ACQUIRE LEVEL ONE FOR APPROXIMATELY $2.2 BILLION IN 
STOCK-FOR-STOCK MERGER

ACQUISITION AIMED AT BUILDING NETWORK SYSTEMS IN SILICON

     NOTE: Intel and Level One executives will host a teleconference to discuss
the details of this agreement and answer questions at 2:15 p.m. (PST) on
Thursday, March 4. Press and analysts interested in hearing about this
announcement may call into the teleconference by dialing 800-967-7184 to
participate. International callers dial 719-457-2633. The confirmation number is
639282 for all callers. A full recording of the briefing can be accessed through

     SANTA CLARA, Calif. and SACRAMENTO, Calif. March 4, 1999 - Intel
Corporation and Level One Communications today announced that the boards of
directors of both companies have approved a definitive stock-for-stock merger
agreement valued at approximately $2.2 billion under which Intel would acquire
Level One. The acquisition is aimed at bringing customers advanced networking
capabilities by offering increased bandwidth and functionality through silicon
integration. The Sacramento-based Level One provides silicon connectivity
solutions for high-speed telecom and networking applications and is expected to
establish Intel as a leading component supplier for the rapidly growing Internet
and Intranet equipment market segments.

     Under the terms of the agreement, each share of Level One stock would be
exchanged for 0.43 shares of Intel stock and the merger would be accounted for
using the purchase accounting method. A total of approximately 18.6 million
shares of Intel stock would be issued to consummate the tax-free merger
(including the presumed conversion of Level One's outstanding convertible
subordinated notes into Level One common stock when permissible under their
terms). The exchange rate and the total number of shares will be adjusted for
Intel's previously announced 2 for 1 stock split. The transaction is subject to
regulatory review, Level One stockholder approval and other normal closing
conditions. Upon completion of the merger, which is expected by the end of the
second quarter of 1999, Level One will become a wholly-owned subsidiary
reporting into Intel's Network Communications Group and all Level One employees
will continue as employees of this subsidiary.

     "Today's announced merger extends our strength in networking and
communications," said Craig Barrett, president and CEO of Intel. "It provides us
with the silicon building blocks necessary to supply the rapidly growing demands
created by the Internet and e-commerce."

     "This merger benefits Level One employees and customers by delivering on
our vision of highly integrated communications systems on silicon," said Robert
Pepper, Level One's president and CEO who will join Intel as vice president of
the company's Network Communications Group and general manager of the Level One
Components Division.

     "We've been fortunate to have worked with Level One on several programs
over the past year, and discovered our common vision and corporate cultural
values to be a great match," said Mark Christensen vice president and general
manager of Intel's Network Communications Group. The companies do not anticipate
any immediate changes to either of their product lines and Level One intends to
continue to use its existing manufacturing relationships and provide its
products to customers under existing agreements.

     Level One Communications (Nasdaq: LEVL), a leader in communications IC
technology, provides silicon connectivity solutions for high-speed telecom and
networking applications. These components are critical connecting links in

The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ 
materially from those described in these forward-looking statements: the risk
that Level One's business will not be successfully integrated with Intel's
business; costs associated with the merger; the inability to obtain the approval
of Level One's stockholders; matters arising in connection with the parties'
efforts to comply with applicable regulatory and tax requirements relating to
the transaction; and increased competition and technological changes in the
industries in which Intel and Level One compete. For a detailed discussion of
these and other cautionary statements, please refer to Intel's and Level One's
filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including their respective
Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the year ended Dec. 27, 1997 for Intel, and Dec.

One.
