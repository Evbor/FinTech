     AMD, INTEL SETTLE ALL LEGAL DISPUTES
     
     SANTA CLARA, Calif., January 11, 1995 -- Advanced Micro Devices, 
     Inc. and Intel Corporation said they have reached agreement to 
     settle all outstanding legal disputes between the two companies.  
          Following are the major points of the agreement:
               *    AMD will have a perpetual license to the microcode 
                    in the Intel386(tm) and Intel486(tm)                
                    microprocessors.
     
               *    AMD agrees that it has no right to copy any other  
                    Intel microcode including the Pentium(tm)          
                    Processor, P6 microcode and 486 ICE (in circuit    
                    emulation) microcode. 
     
               *    The companies will negotiate a new patent          
                    cross-license agreement to become effective        
                    1/1/96. 
     
               *    Intel will receive $58 million as settlement for   
                    past damages in the 486 ICE case.  As ordered in   
                    the 1992 arbitration between the two companies,    
                    Intel will pay AMD approximately $18 million       
                    (which includes interest) awarded by the           
                    arbitrator for breach of contract and will not     
                    contest the rights granted AMD in the              
                    arbitration award.
                        
               *    Intel and AMD will drop all cases including        
                    appeals currently in the courts.                  
               
               *    AMD will drop its antitrust case against Intel.
     
               *    AMD will have the right to use foundries for       
                    Am486(tm) products containing Intel microcode for  
                    up to 20% of its 486 production.
               
               *    AMD and its customers will get a license on        
                    Intel's "Crawford `338" patent, covering memory    
                    management.    
               
               *    The two companies will agree not to initiate legal 
                    action against one another for any activity      
                    occurring prior to January 6, 1995.
     
          The two companies said they have been in negotiations for 4 
     months. The talks were suggested by Judge Magistrate Patricia 
     Trumbull of the U.S. District Court in San Jose, who presided in 
     the 386 and 486 cases.  
          In a joint statement, Richard Previte, president and chief 
     operating officer of AMD, and Craig Barrett, executive vice 
     president and chief operating officer of Intel, said "We are 
     pleased to reach an agreement that will enable the two companies 
     to concentrate on competing in the marketplace, not the courts.  
     This is clearly in the best interests of our customers, our 
     stockholders and the PC marketplace."  Messrs. Previte and 
     Barrett were the lead negotiators of the agreement.  
          AMD is the fifth-largest U.S. manufacturer of integrated 
     circuits.  Focusing on the personal and networked computing and 
     communications markets, AMD produces micrprocessors and related 
     peripherals, memories, programmable logic devices and circuits 
     for telecommunications and networking applications.
          Intel, the world's largest chip maker, is also a leading 
     manufacturer of personal computer, networking and communications 
     products.

             INTEL 1994 REVENUE, EARNINGS PER SHARE SET RECORDS
                Q4 Results impacted by a $475 million charge
SANTA CLARA, Calif., January 17, 1995 -- Driven by a robust personal computer 
market, Intel Corporation's 1994 revenue and earnings per share set new records,
the company announced today.
     Revenue totaled $11.52 billion, up 31% from $8.78 billion for 1993.  As a
result of a one-time pretax charge of $475 million, net income decreased 
slightly to $2.29 billion, from $2.30 billion for the previous year.  After the 
charge, which amounted to $0.70 per share, earnings per share increased to $5.24
 from $5.20 per share for 1993.
     Fourth quarter revenue of $3.23 billion, up 35% from $2.39 billion a year 
ago, marked the first quarter in which Intel's revenue exceeded $3 billion.  Net
income totaled $372 million, down 37% from $594 million for the fourth quarter
of 1993.  Post-charge earnings per share were $0.86, versus $1.35 a year 
earlier.
     The fourth quarter results announced today compare with third quarter
revenue of $2.86 billion, and net income of $659 million or $1.52 per share.  
Third quarter pretax income benefited from $45 million of non-recurring items or
approximately $0.07 earnings per share.
     Fourth quarter 1994 revenue and cost of sales were impacted by a one-time 
charge taken to cover replacement and other costs associated with a divide 
problem in the floating point unit of the company's Pentium(tm) processor.  As a
result, fourth quarter gross margin was reduced by $475 million.  This charge
resulted in a $0.70 per share impact to fourth quarter and 1994 earnings per
share.
     Based on Intel's analysis, the problem can result in reduced precision in 
floating point divide operations once in every nine billion random number pairs.
n December, the company offered to replace the processor for any PC owner whose
system is based on this version of the Pentium processor.
     The charge covers replacement costs, replacement material and writedown of
the company's inventory of the earlier versions of Pentium processors.  The
company said it believed the charge announced today will be sufficient to cover 
all associated costs.  
     In 1994, Intel repurchased a total of 10.9 million shares of common stock 
at a cost of $658 million under its stock repurchase program.
     President and Chief Executive Officer Andrew S. Grove, said, "Demand was 
very strong for both Pentium and Intel486(tm) processors during the holiday 
season.  Unit shipments of the Pentium processor approximately doubled versus 
the previous quarter and we expect continued strong growth in the first quarter
 of 1995.
     "We have done a very rapid manufacturing cutover to the updated version of 
the Pentium processor, and currently all Pentium processor shipments are of the 
updated version.  We were able to make this very rapid transition because 
Intel's manufacturing operation performed so well.  The usual holiday shutdowns
were canceled and the group pulled out all the stops to ramp production of the 
updated version.
     "The replacement program is complex.  We serve hundreds of manufacturers of
Pentium processor-based systems worldwide.  They use a variety of heat sinks, 
sockets and motherboards, and we offer five speed selections of Pentium 
processors in various packages.  Almost overnight, we created an infrastructure 
to serve thousands of callers daily, and to get the right replacement processor 
in their machines as quickly as possible.  Our people are working hard to make 
this happen.
     "The Pentium processor divide problem has been a learning experience for 
Intel.  In the end, I think it will strengthen the company by improving our
policies and infrastructure for serving consumers with a wide range of computing
needs," Dr. Grove said.

BUSINESS UPDATE
- ---------------
Processor Products
- ------------------
     Key Q4 1994 developments in the company's processor products business 
include the following:
*  Unit volume of microprocessor shipments set a new quarterly record.
*  In spite of very strong Intel486 bookings in the fourth quarter, the dollar 
   volume of fourth quarter Pentium processor bookings was larger than bookings
   of the Intel486 chip for the first time.
*  The company said approximately 23% of its fourth quarter processor unit
   shipments for the desktop computer market segment were represented by the 
   Pentium processor.
*  The 100-MHz Pentium processor moved into volume production during the 
   quarter.
*  Intel achieved its goal of doubling microprocessor performance at major PC 
   price points in 1994.  For example, during the December 1993 holiday season 
   the consumer was able to purchase a PC based on the Intel486 DX2-50MHz
   processor with 4 megabytes of RAM, a 200 megabyte hard disk drive and monitor
   for about $2,000.  In the December 1994 holiday season that same $2,000 would
   enable the consumer to purchase a PC based on the 60-MHz Pentium processor 
   with 8 megabytes of RAM, a 400+ megabyte hard disk drive and monitor.
*  Quarterly unit volume of PC board shipments set a new Intel record.  The
   company expects quarterly unit volume of PC board shipments to continue to 
   increase in 1995.
*  At the 1994 Comdex Computer show, NEC Corporation, Texas Instruments 
   Incorporated, and Toshiba Corp. demonstrated new PC notebook products based 
   on the 75-MHz Pentium processor.  To date, 28 companies have announced plans 
   to produce mobile PCs based on the Pentium processor.
*  Intel's Scalable Systems Division set a new world supercomputing record.  The
   Paragon(tm) XP/S MP supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, employing
   6,768 Intel I860(R) XP processors, performed in excess of 281 billion 
   instructions per second on certain applications. This represents a 
   performance increase of over 50% from the prior speed record.

Communications & Network Products
- ---------------------------------
     In the fourth quarter Intel announced new products and enhanced capability
for its ProShare(tm) personal conferencing family.  The ProShare Video System 
200 now includes the capability to conduct video conferences over local area 
networks (LAN) in addition to ISDN (integrated services digital network) 
networks.  Intel also introduced an extension of its LANDesk(tm) Manager family
that allows network administrators to manage the deployment of video 
conferencing over existing corporate networks.  In its December 94 issue, PC 
Computing selected LANDesk manager software as the 1994 most valuable product in
networking management.
     Intel acquired certain assets of Shany Computers, Ltd. this quarter.  
Shany's flagship AlertVIEW(R) product detects, diagnoses, and corrects LAN-based
PC software application errors across a wide spectrum of networking 
environments.  The acquired assets will further Intel's end-to-end network
management strategy by complementing the company's PC LAN management LANDesk 
product family.

Semiconductor Products
- ----------------------
     Sales of Intel's flash memory products reached a new record in the fourth 
quarter as Intel continued to be the number one supplier of flash memory chips 
in the world.  Applications for flash memory in wireless communications and 
networking products have been the principal drivers of growth in Intel's flash 
memory business in recent quarters.  Intel also announced two 16-megabit 
embedded flash RAM devices featuring high-performance interfaces that allow both
code storage and direct data execution.
     During the fourth quarter, Intel introduced new microcontrollers based on 
the MCS(R) 251 architecture.  These new 8-bit microcontrollers are expected to
give customers a 5-15 times performance improvement over current 8-bit devices
while preserving full compatibility with existing system design and support 
software.

Geographic Review
- -----------------
     Intel's revenue breakdown by major geographic regions is summarized below:
                                         Q4 93          Q3 94          Q4 94
Percent of revenue
      by geographic area
Americas                                   45             53             48
Europe                                     33             23             32
Asia Pacific                               14             15             12
Japan                                       8              9              8

     Bookings for the fourth quarter were slightly greater than billings due to
a robust PC market.  Fourth quarter 1994 bookings set a record.
     A healthy rebound in European sales in the fourth quarter and growth in the
Americas market drove the revenue increase.  Sales in the Asia-Pacific and Japan
markets were down from the prior quarter.

Manufacturing Review
- --------------------
     The company has successfully transitioned to the new stepping needed to 
produce the updated version of the Pentium processor without the floating point
divide problem.
     Fab 5 in Oregon converted its existing six-inch wafer, 0.8-micron capacity
to six-inch wafer, 0.6- micron technology.  The converted Fab 5 was qualified
for production and began shipping volume quantities of advanced Intel486 and 
Pentium processors in the fourth quarter.  Conversion of existing six-inch
wafer, 0.8-micron capacity to advanced 0.6-micron capacity continues at Fab 9 in
New Mexico.
     The company completed a project to upgrade Fab D1, in Aloha, Oregon to a 
full production facility.  Fab D1, which features the next generation 
0.35-micron process technology, will begin to ramp shortly.  Additional 
state-of-the-art 0.35-micron capacity is being readied at Fab 11 in New Mexico.
     During the fourth quarter Intel announced and began major expansions in its
production and process technology research and development (R&D) facilities. 
The company began the expansion of its Fab D2 production facility in Santa Clara
that will roughly double the size of the existing facility.  The company also 
broke ground on a new R&D facility in Oregon known as Fab D1b.  Fab D1b will 
initially serve as a home for Oregon's Portland Technology Development 
operation, which creates the manufacturing recipes for future Intel chips. 
The plant will develop technologies in the sub-0.25-micron range and later be 
converted into a manufacturing facility.

Marketing Review
- ----------------
     Intel continued its Pentium processor merchandising campaign during the 
fourth quarter with extensive television advertisements and cooperative 
advertising in retail stores.
     Intel's "Passport To The World" exhibit at the Comdex computer show and 
Consumer Electronics show in Las Vegas featured a six minute presentation of
some of the latest PC applications, including ProShare video conferencing, and 
CNN-At-Work*, running on Pentium processor-based systems in real-world 
situations.

FINANCIAL REVIEW
- ----------------
Income Statement
- ----------------
     Q4 1994 net revenue was up 13% from Q3 1994, driven by higher revenue from
Pentium processors, and board-level products.  Fourth quarter revenue was 
reduced slightly by the revenue portion of the charge for Pentium processors 
with the floating point divide problem.
     Cost of sales in Q4 1994 increased 59% from Q3 1994, driven by a one-time 
charge to cover costs related to inventory writedown and replacement of Pentium 
processors containing the floating point divide problem, and higher volumes of 
board-level products.  Primarily as a result of these items, gross margin 
percentage decreased 18 percentage points and gross margin dollars decreased by 
$385 million from Q3 1994.
     Q4 1994 total expenses increased 11% from Q3 1994.  Marketing, general and 
administrative expenses increased $64 million primarily as a result of 
expenditures for the Pentium processor merchandising campaign.
     Interest and other income was $67 million.  The company expects interest 
and other income to be in the $65 million range for Q1 1995, subject to 
prevailing interest rates and excluding the litigation settlement with Advanced 
Micro Devices, Inc.  The tax rate throughout 1994 was 36.5%.  For 1995, the 
company expects its tax rate to be 37.0%.
    Shares and equivalents used in the calculation of earnings per share 
decreased primarily as a result of the stock repurchase program.  Shares and 
equivalents are summarized below:

Balance Sheet
     Intel's net cash position (short- and long-term investments less short- and
 long-term debt) increased by $256 million in Q4 1994 to $3.63 billion.  
Significant components of the changes in cash for Q4 1994 and year-to-date are

     Net inventories decreased $209 million in the quarter to $1.17 billion.  
The decrease was primarily due to the writedown of inventories of Pentium 
processors containing the floating point divide problem.

     Capital spending was $760 million and depreciation was $282 million in Q4
1994.  For 1994, capital spending was $2.44 billion and depreciation was $1.03 
billion.  The company expects 1995 capital spending to be about $2.9 billion and
1995 depreciation to be about $1.4 billion.
     Accounts receivable increased by $69 million in the quarter primarily as a 
result of record billings.  The company's average-days-sales-outstanding was 48
at the end of Q4 1994 compared with 45 at the end of Q3 1994.
     During Q4 1994, the company repurchased 1.8 million shares of common stock
at a cost of $111 million (including $65 million to repurchase 1.0 million 
shares in connection with the exercise of 1.0 million put warrants) and sold an 
additional 2.0 million put warrants for proceeds of $11 million.  As of December
31, 1994, the company's potential put warrant obligation was $744 million to buy
 back 12.5 million shares of common stock.  Of the total 55.0 million shares 
authorized for repurchase, approximately 24.6 million shares have been 
repurchased and 17.9 million shares of common stock remained available for 
repurchase under the stock repurchase program, after reserving shares to cover 
outstanding put warrants.
