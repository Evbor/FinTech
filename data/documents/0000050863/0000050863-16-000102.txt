<div style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; TEXT-ALIGN: left; TEXT-INDENT: 36pt">Article II, Section 9 of the Bylaws, as amended, provides for a stockholder, or a group of up to 20 stockholders, that has owned at least 3% of the Corporation's outstanding common stock continuously for at least three years to nominate and include in the Corporation's proxy materials up to the greater of two directors and 20% of the number of the Corporation's directors then in office, provided that the stockholder(s) and the nominee(s) satisfy the requirements specified in the Bylaws.&#160; Prior to adopting the new proxy access provisions, the Corporation engaged in discussions with a number of its stockholders to assess their views on appropriate proxy access terms, allowing the Board to implement terms that it believes will provide meaningful proxy access rights for stockholders while furthering the long-term interests of the Corporation and its stockholders.</div>

<div><br>
</div>

<div style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; TEXT-ALIGN: left; TEXT-INDENT: 36pt">The amendments to the Bylaws also revise provisions relating to calling and conducting stockholder, Board and Board committee meetings; revise the period for delivering notice to the Corporation of nominations and proposals intended to be presented by stockholders and the information to be included in any such notice; and make other clarifying or conforming changes.&#160; The amendments to the Bylaws are effective immediately, except that the amendment in Article II, Section 8(b), setting forth the period for advance notice of business or nominations to be presented at an annual stockholders meeting, are effective as of February 18, 2016, so that the notice period with respect to the Corporation's 2016 annual stockholders' meeting remain as set forth in the Corporation's 2015 proxy statement.</div>
