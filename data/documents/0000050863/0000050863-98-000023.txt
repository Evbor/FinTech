EXHIBIT 99.1

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

                Intergraph Corporation vs. Intel
                                
 U.S. District Court, Northern District of Alabama, Northeastern
                   Division (CV-97-N-3023-NE)
                                
In  November  1997,  Intergraph Corporation ("Intergraph")  filed
suit in Federal District Court in Alabama generally alleging that
Intel  attempted to coerce Intergraph into relinquishing  certain
patent  rights relating to microprocessor and chipset interaction
in  multiprocessor workstations. The suit also alleges that Intel
infringes   three   Intergraph  patents  and   includes   alleged
violations  of  antitrust laws. The suit seeks injunctive  relief
along  with  unspecified damages. In November 1997,  Intel  filed
suit  against Intergraph in Federal District Court in  California
seeking  a  declaratory judgment that the Intergraph patents  are
invalid.  Intel  also filed an action in the same court  alleging
breach of contract and misappropriation of trade secrets based on
Intergraph's refusal to return Intel confidential information  as
contractually  required. Although the ultimate  outcome  of  this
lawsuit  cannot be determined at this time, management, including
internal counsel, does not believe that the ultimate outcome will
have  a material adverse effect on Intel's financial position  or
overall trends in results of operations.

                   Cyrix Corporation vs. Intel
                                
           U.S. District Court, E.D. Texas (4-97cv164)
                                
Cyrix Corporation brought suit in Federal District Court in Texas
in  May  1997, alleging that Intel infringed two patents relating
to  microprocessors.  Cyrix became a wholly owned  subsidiary  of
National Semiconductor Corporation ("National") in November 1997.
On February 3, 1998, Intel and National  announced that they have
settled  the Cyrix lawsuit and extended the term of the  existing
patent cross-license agreement between the companies.

                  Michael W. Scriber vs. Intel
                                
   U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon (CV-1262-AS)
                                
Michael  W. Scriber, a former employee of the Company,  filed  an
action  in September 1996 alleging that Intel's products infringe
a  patent  issued  to  the plaintiff and  that  Intel  wrongfully
terminated his employment. On January 21, 1998, the court granted
Intel's  motions  for  summary  judgment  on  all  claims.    The
plaintiff has appealed the decision.
