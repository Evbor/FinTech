Mr.&nbsp;Bryant has extensive knowledge of Intel&#146;s business and strategy, having worked at Intel for 37 years in a variety of senior executive positions, including Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer, and serving as
Chairman of the Board for the past six years. The Board believes that it is in the Company&#146;s best interests for Mr.&nbsp;Bryant to continue serving as Chairman of the Board for one additional year in order to help onboard and integrate the
Company&#146;s new directors. Accordingly, on March&nbsp;14, 2018, the Board determined to waive the Company&#146;s Board Chair Term Limit for one year to permit Mr.&nbsp;Bryant to continue serving as Chairman of the Board through the conclusion of

where the required undertaking has been tendered to the corporation) that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct that make it permissible under the Delaware General Corporation Law for the corporation to indemnify the claimant for the
