Intel Corporation Bylaws (the &#147;Bylaws&#148;), effective immediately, to reduce the minimum aggregate stock ownership required for stockholders to call a special meeting from twenty-five percent (25%) to fifteen percent (15%) and add a new
Article&nbsp;XIII, Forum for Adjudication of Disputes. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:ARIAL">Article II, Section&nbsp;3 of the Company&#146;s Bylaws, as amended, provides that special meetings of the

matters to be brought before the proposed special meeting. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:ARIAL">New Article XIII provides that, unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an
alternative forum, the Delaware Court of Chancery will be the sole and exclusive forum for (i)&nbsp;any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company, (ii)&nbsp;any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by
any director, officer, employee, or agent of the Company to the Company or to the Company&#146;s stockholders, including a claim alleging the aiding and abetting of such a breach of fiduciary duty, (iii)&nbsp;any action asserting a claim arising
pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the &#147;DGCL&#148;) or the Company&#146;s certificate of incorporation or Bylaws, (iv)&nbsp;any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine of the State of
Delaware, or (v)&nbsp;any action asserting an &#147;internal corporate claim&#148; as that term is defined in Section&nbsp;115 of the DGCL. The new Article XIII of the Bylaws further provides, among other provisions, that the sole and exclusive
forum for any action or proceeding over which the Delaware Court of Chancery lacks subject matter jurisdiction will be the federal district court for the District of Delaware. </P>
