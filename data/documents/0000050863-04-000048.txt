                          PRESS RELEASE


           INTEL SETTLES INTERGRAPH PATENT LITIGATION

SANTA  CLARA,  Calif., March 30, 2004 - Intel  Corporation  today
announced  it  has  settled  the remaining  issues  in  a  patent
infringement  suit  pending in U.S. District Court  in  Marshall,
Texas relating to Intel's Itanium(R) microprocessors. Under terms
of the settlement Intel and Intergraph will move for dismissal of
the  case  with prejudice. As a result, neither company  has  any
further  financial  obligations  under  an  earlier  April   2002
settlement agreement.

In addition, under terms of the current settlement Intergraph has
granted  Dell  Inc.  certain licenses to Intergraph  patents  and
agreed   to  dismiss  Intergraph's  separate  pending  litigation
against  Dell.  Intergraph sued Dell for patent  infringement  in
December  2002.  This  agreement gives  Dell  a  license  to  all
Intergraph-owned  patents, and covers past,  present  and  future
Dell  products. Dell has a unique indemnity agreement with  Intel
that  Dell  claims obligates Intel to indemnify the company  from
patent  infringement  claims in the litigation  which  relate  to
combining  Intel  microprocessors and other  components  in  Dell
systems.  Intel  disagrees  with  Dell's  interpretation  of  the
agreement, but has decided to remove the current dispute from the
courts and resolve the disagreement privately.

The  new  settlement with Intergraph also includes a covenant  by
Intergraph  not  to  sue any Intel customers  for  products  that
include   Intel   microprocessors,  Intel  chipsets   and   Intel
motherboards in combination.

As  part of the current agreement, Intel will pay Intergraph $225
million. Intel will pay $125 million to Intergraph by April 5 and
$25  million  in  each of the next four quarters. The  accounting
treatment  for  the  settlement  has  not  yet  been  determined.
However,  Intel expects some portion or all of the  $225  million
will reduce earnings in the first quarter of 2004.

Intel,  the  world's  largest  chip  maker,  is  also  a  leading
manufacturer of computer, networking and communications products.
