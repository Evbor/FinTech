             INTEL ANNOUNCES MANAGEMENT CHANGES

SANTA CLARA, Calif., July 20, 2006 - Intel Corporation
today announced that it is making a number of senior
management changes focused on improving the company's
structure and achieving faster and better decision
making. The company also announced that two senior
executives will be retiring.

     "As part of the thorough analysis of Intel begun
in April, we have examined the focus and structure of
our top management level, including our use of 'two-in-
a-box' co-managers," said Intel President and CEO Paul
Otellini. "The moves announced today will help us speed
decision making and bring new resources to bear in
critical areas, while allowing me to spend more time on
key strategic issues."

     The management changes include:

     Intel's Sales and Marketing Group will be led by
Executive Vice President Sean Maloney, 50, who
previously co-managed the company's Mobility Group.
Maloney will also become Intel's chief sales and
marketing officer. Donald MacDonald, who was previously
vice president and general manager of the Digital Home
Group, will become vice president of Marketing and
Brands, reporting to Maloney.

     Senior Vice President David Perlmutter, 53, will
continue as general manager of the Mobility Group.
Senior Vice President Anand Chandrasekher, 43, formerly
co-general manager of the Sales and Marketing Group,
will manage a newly created business unit focused on
low power Intel Architecture products and the ultra-
mobile PC market. He will report to Perlmutter.

     Eric Kim, 51, senior vice president, who
previously co-managed the Sales and Marketing Group,
will become general manager of the Digital Home Group.

     William Siu, a 26-year Intel veteran who served as
vice president and general manager of the Channel
Platforms Group, and Richard Wirt, who has 25 years of
service and is vice president, senior fellow and co-
general manager of the Software and Solutions Group,
announced their retirements. Both of these executives
will remain full time with Intel through the end of the
year to best manage their organizations' transitions.
With the impending retirement of Siu, the Channel
Platforms Group will report to Maloney in the Sales and
Marketing Group. A general manager for the Channel
Platforms Group will be named at a later date.

     Renee James, vice president and co-general manager
of the Software and Solutions Group, will continue to
manage the group following Wirt's retirement at the end
of the year.

     "I want to express my deep appreciation to Bill
Siu and Richard Wirt for their numerous contributions
and dedicated service to Intel over many years,"
continued Otellini.  "We thank them very much and wish
them all the best in their retirement."

     The management changes are effective immediately.

     Intel, the world leader in silicon innovation,
develops technologies, products and initiatives to
continually advance how people work and live.
