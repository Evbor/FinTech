    Financial Review

    --  Revenue of $10.1 billion was up 16 percent sequentially,
        primarily driven by growth in Mobility and Digital Enterprise
        Group processors of 14 percent, with related chipsets and
        other products up 19 percent.



        -- Total microprocessor units set a record; the average
            selling price was flat.

        -- Chipset and flash memory units set records.

        -- Motherboard units were lower.


    --  Gross margin was 52.4 percent, up from 46.9 percent in the
        second quarter. The increase was primarily driven by higher
        microprocessor volumes, lower 45nm start-up costs and lower
        microprocessor unit costs, partially offset by write-offs for
        manufacturing costs related to upcoming 45nm processors that
        had not yet qualified for valuation during the quarter.

    --  Spending was $2.9 billion, higher than $2.6 billion in the
        second quarter, primarily driven by higher revenue- and
        profit-dependent expenses along with higher R&D spending as
        process engineers moved from 45nm start-up activities to 32nm
        development.

    Business Outlook

    The following expectations do not include the potential impact of
any mergers, acquisitions, divestitures or other business combinations
that may be completed after Oct. 15.

    Q4 2007 Outlook

    --  Revenue: Between $10.5 billion and $11.1 billion.

    --  Gross margin: 57 percent plus or minus a couple of points.

    --  Spending (R&D plus MG&A): Between $2.8 billion and $3.0
        billion.

        unchanged.

    The above statements and any others in this document that refer to
plans and expectations for the fourth quarter, the year and the future
are forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and
uncertainties. Many factors could affect Intel's actual results, and
variances from Intel's current expectations regarding such factors
could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed
in these forward-looking statements. Intel presently considers the
factors set forth below in the section titled "Risk Factors" to be the
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially
from the corporation's published expectations.

    Recent Highlights

    --  Intel shipped more than 2 million quad core processors during
        the quarter and now offers more than 20 quad-core processor
        designs.

    --  Intel introduced the industry's first quad-core processors
        specifically designed for multi-processor (MP) servers,
        delivering twice the performance and three times the
        performance-per-watt of the company's previous-generation
        products. The introduction completes the company's transition
        to the energy-efficient Intel(R) Core(TM) microprocessor
        architecture.

    --  The company launched the next generation of Intel(R) vPro(TM)
        processor technology for business desktop PCs featuring
        innovations that better protect against hacking and viruses
        while giving IT managers new ways to remotely manage and
        repair systems.

    --  At the Intel Developer Forum (IDF), the company announced that
        the world's first 45nm microprocessors, based on Intel's
        breakthrough 45nm Hi-k metal gate chip technology, will be
        introduced Nov. 12. The company demonstrated its
        second-generation 45nm microprocessor architecture, code-named
        Nehalem, which is on track for production in the second half
        of next year. Intel also announced the production of test
        chips based on the company's next-generation, 32nm process
        technology, scheduled for 2009.

    --  Also at IDF, Intel announced that its 2008 notebook PC
        platform, code-named Montevina, will include 25-watt dual-core
        processors that enable even thinner and lighter designs.
        Several leading PC makers announced plans to ship Intel
        Montevina-based notebooks with WiMAX technology next year.
        Nokia announced plans to include Intel WiMAX silicon in its
        Internet tablet products, scheduled for 2008.

    --  Intel acquired Havok, a leading developer of the software used
        by digital artists to animate movies and computer games. The
        acquisition will help Intel to accelerate its capabilities in
        visual computing and graphics.

    Risk Factors

    --  Intel operates in intensely competitive industries that are
        characterized by a high percentage of costs that are fixed or
        difficult to reduce in the short term, significant pricing
        pressures, and product demand that is highly variable and
        difficult to forecast. Additionally, Intel is in the process
        of transitioning to its next generation of products on 45nm
        process technology, and there could be execution issues
        associated with these changes, including product defects and
        errata along with lower than anticipated manufacturing yields.
        Revenue and the gross margin percentage are affected by the
        timing of new Intel product introductions and the demand for
        and market acceptance of Intel's products; actions taken by
        Intel's competitors, including product offerings and
        introductions, marketing programs and pricing pressures and
        Intel's response to such actions; Intel's ability to respond
        quickly to technological developments and to incorporate new
        features into its products; and the availability of sufficient
        components from suppliers to meet demand. Factors that could
        cause demand to be different from Intel's expectations include
        customer acceptance of Intel's and competitors' products;
        changes in customer order patterns, including order
        cancellations; changes in the level of inventory at customers;
        and changes in business and economic conditions, including
        conditions in the credit market that could affect consumer
        confidence and result in lower than expected demand for our
        products.

    --  The gross margin percentage could vary significantly from
        expectations based on changes in revenue levels; product mix
        and pricing; capacity utilization; variations in inventory
        valuation, including variations related to the timing of
        qualifying products for sale; excess or obsolete inventory;
        manufacturing yields; changes in unit costs; impairments of
        long-lived assets, including manufacturing, assembly/test and
        intangible assets; and the timing and execution of the
        manufacturing ramp and associated costs, including start-up
        costs.

    --  Expenses, particularly certain marketing and compensation
        expenses, vary depending on the level of demand for Intel's
        products, the level of revenue and profits, and impairments of
        long-lived assets.

    --  Intel is in the midst of a structure and efficiency program
        that is resulting in several actions that could have an impact
        on expected expense levels and gross margin.

    --  The tax rate expectation is based on current tax law and
        current expected income. The tax rate may be affected by the
        closing of acquisitions or divestitures; the jurisdictions in
        which profits are determined to be earned and taxed; changes
        in the estimates of credits, benefits and deductions; the
        resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax
        authorities, including payment of interest and penalties; and
        the ability to realize deferred tax assets.

    --  Gains or losses from equity securities and interest and other
        could vary from expectations depending on fixed income and
        equity market volatility; gains or losses realized on the sale
        or exchange of securities; gains or losses from equity method
        investments; impairment charges related to marketable,
        non-marketable and other investments; interest rates; cash
        balances; and changes in fair value of derivative instruments.

    --  Intel's results could be affected by the amount, type, and
        valuation of share-based awards granted as well as the amount
        of awards cancelled due to employee turnover and the timing of
        award exercises by employees.

    --  Intel's results could be impacted by adverse economic, social,
        political and physical/infrastructure conditions in the
        countries in which Intel, its customers or its suppliers
        operate, including military conflict and other security risks,
        natural disasters, infrastructure disruptions, health concerns
        and fluctuations in currency exchange rates.

    --  Intel's results could be affected by adverse effects
        associated with product defects and errata (deviations from
        published specifications), and by litigation or regulatory
        matters involving intellectual property, stockholder,
        consumer, antitrust and other issues, such as the litigation
        and regulatory matters described in Intel's SEC reports.

    A detailed discussion of these and other factors that could affect
Intel's results is included in Intel's SEC filings, including the
report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2007.

    Status of Business Outlook

    During the quarter, Intel's corporate representatives may
reiterate the Business Outlook during private meetings with investors,
investment analysts, the media and others. From the close of business
on Nov. 30 until publication of the company's fourth-quarter 2007
earnings release, Intel will observe a "Quiet Period" during which the
Business Outlook disclosed in the company's press releases and filings
with the SEC should be considered to be historical, speaking as of
prior to the Quiet Period only and not subject to an update by the
company.

    Earnings Webcast

Our operating segments include the Digital Enterprise Group, Mobility
 Group, Flash Memory Group, Digital Home Group, and Digital Health
 Group. The Digital Home Group and Digital Health Group operating
 segments are included within the "all other" category. In the first
 quarter of 2007, the Channel Platforms Group began directly
 supporting our operating segments. We adjusted prior-period amounts
 to reflect certain minor reorganizations. In the second quarter of
 2007, we agreed to sell certain NOR flash memory assets to a new
 flash memory company, Numonyx, that we plan to form with
 STMicroelectronics and Francisco Partners L.P.

We have sales and marketing, manufacturing, finance, and
 administration groups. Expenses for these groups are generally
 allocated to the operating segments and the expenses are included in
 the operating results reported above. Additionally, in the first
 quarter of 2007, we began allocating share-based compensation to the
 operating segments and adjusted results to reflect this change.
 Revenue for the "all other" category primarily relates to
 microprocessors and related chipsets sold by the Digital Home Group.
 The "all other" category also includes certain corporate-level
 operating expenses and charges. These expenses and charges include:
   -- a portion of profit-dependent bonuses and other expenses not
    allocated to the operating segments;
   -- results of operations of seed businesses that support our
    initiatives;
   -- acquisition-related costs, including amortization and any
    impairment of acquisition-related intangibles and goodwill;
   -- charges for purchased in-process research and development; and
   -- amounts included within restructuring and asset impairment
    charges on the consolidated summary income statement data.
