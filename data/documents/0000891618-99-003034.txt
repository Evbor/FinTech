INTEL TO ACQUIRE SOFTCOM

SANTA CLARA, Calif., July 7, 1999 - Intel Corporation today announced it has

Tony Stelliga, president & CEO of Softcom, will continue as general manager of
Softcom, reporting to Mark Christensen, vice president and general manager of
Intel's Network Communications Group. In addition, all Softcom employees will
become employees of a subsidiary of Intel.

Intel, the world's largest chip maker, is also a leading manufacturer of
