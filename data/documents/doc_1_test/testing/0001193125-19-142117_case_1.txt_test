On May 8, 2019, Intel Corporation (Intel) held a publicly available webcast meeting for investors and the general public (the

S.M. (Murthy) Renduchintala, Executive Vice President; Group President, Technology, Systems Architecture and Client Group, and Chief Engineering Officer; (3) Navin Shenoy, Executive Vice President; General Manager, Data Center

These presentations and a recording of the webcast may also be found on Intels Investor Relations website, www.intc.com.
The presentations contain forward-looking statements relating to Intels financial plan as well as other statements that refer to future plans and
expectations, including with respect to Intels future technologies and the expected benefits of such technologies. Such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Words such as anticipates, expects,
intends, goals, plans, believes, seeks, estimates, continues, may, will, would, should, could, and
variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Statements that refer to or are based on estimates, forecasts, projections, uncertain events or assumptions, including statements relating to total
addressable market (TAM) or market opportunity, future products and the expected availability and benefits of such products, and anticipated trends in our businesses or the markets relevant to them, also identify forward-looking statements. Such
statements are based on current expectations and involve many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause actual
results to differ materially from the companys expectations are set forth in Intels most recent earnings release dated April 25, 2019, which is included as an exhibit to Intels Form
