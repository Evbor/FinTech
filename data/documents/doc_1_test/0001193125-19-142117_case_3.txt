beyond represent targets and are based on internal forecasts subject to significant uncertainty. We are unable to provide a full reconciliation of such measures to GAAP measures without unreasonable efforts as we cannot predict the amount or timing
of certain elements that are included in reported GAAP results and that may significantly affect GAAP results, including acquisition-related adjustments and other non-recurring events or transactions. In addition, certain comparable GAAP measures
such as net cash provided by operating activities are difficult to accurately estimate for such time frames and are dependent on future events. We believe such a reconciliation would also imply a degree of precision that could be confusing or
inappropriate for these forward-looking measures. Forward-looking non-GAAP measures relating to fiscal years 2020 and beyond represent targets and are based on internal forecasts subject to significant uncertainty. We are unable to provide a full
