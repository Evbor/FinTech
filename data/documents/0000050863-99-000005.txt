              INTEL REPORTS RECORD QUARTERLY REVENUE,
                        NET INCOME AND EPS
            Twelfth Consecutive Year of Revenue Growth
                                 
SANTA  CLARA,  Calif., Jan.12, 1999 - Intel  Corporation  set  new
quarterly records for revenue, net income, earnings per share  and
microprocessor unit shipments, the company said today.  Seasonally
strong  demand for Intel's P6 micro architecture products  in  the
second  half  lifted the company's total 1998  revenue  to  a  new
annual record.

      Revenue totaled $26.3 billion in 1998, up 5 percent from the
prior  record  of  $25.1 billion in 1997.   Net  income  was  $6.1
billion, down 13 percent from $6.9 billion in 1997.  Earnings  per
share of $3.45 declined 11 percent from $3.87 per share in 1997.

      Record  fourth  quarter revenue of $7.6 billion  was  up  17
percent from fourth quarter 1997 revenue of $6.5 billion.   Fourth
quarter  revenue was up 13 percent from third quarter 1998 revenue
of $6.7 billion.

      Record fourth quarter net income of $2.1 billion was  up  18
percent from fourth quarter 1997 net income of $1.7 billion.   Net
income  in the fourth quarter was up 32 percent from third quarter
1998 net income of $1.6 billion.

      Record  fourth quarter earnings per share of $1.19 increased
21  percent from $0.98 in the fourth quarter of 1997 and  rose  34
percent from $0.89 in the third quarter of 1998.

      "Intel achieved its 12th consecutive year of revenue  growth
in  spite  of the challenges of a turbulent market in 1998,"  said
Dr.  Craig  R.  Barrett,  president and chief  executive  officer.
"During  the  fourth  quarter we achieved record  revenue  in  the
Americas, Europe and Asia-Pacific.

      "Intel enters 1999 with a first quarter roadmap offering new
products in every segment of the computer market.  This quarter we
will  launch  Pentium(R) III and Pentium III Xeon(TM)  processors,
the  first  products in the next generation of Intel  Architecture
microprocessors.  On the manufacturing front we  will  soon  begin
the  transition  to  0.18 micron, the next generation  of  process
technology.

      "The investments of the last year in new product development
and  productivity improvement have strengthened  the  company  and
positioned  it  well  for  a  market  that  will  continue  to  be
competitive and dynamic," Barrett said.

      During  the quarter, the company paid its regular  quarterly
cash  dividend of $0.04 per share.  The dividend was paid on  Dec.
1, 1998, to stockholders of record on Nov. 7, 1998.

<PAGE>

This  is  an increase from the previous $0.03 per share  quarterly
dividend.   Intel has paid a regular quarterly cash  dividend  for
six years, and the dividend has been increased in each of the past
five years.

      In  the  fourth quarter, the company repurchased a total  of
16.5  million  shares of common stock at a cost of  $1.5  billion.
For the full year, the company repurchased 80.9 million shares  at
a  cost  of  $6.7 billion.  Since the program began in  1990,  the
company  has repurchased 294.3 million shares at a total  cost  of
$13.6 billion.
